# BlindBit-cli

This cli application controls the [blindbit daemon (blindbitd)](https://github.com/setavenger/BlindBitd). Send and
receive are the first features to come.
The daemon already has some more features which are not exposed through this cli. Those can be accessed using gRPC tools
like grpcui (unix socket is exposed via `socat`). The cli will be expanded as this project moves forward.
The daemon will also be expanded, stay tuned...
